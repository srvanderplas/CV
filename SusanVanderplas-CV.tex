% \cvitem{Abstract}{\small Research on statistical graphics and visualization generally focuses
% on new types of graphics, new software to create graphics, interactivity, and usability
% studies. Our ability to interpret and use statistical graphics hinges on the interface between
% the graph itself and the brain that perceives and interprets it, and there is substantially less
% research on the interplay between graph, eye, brain, and mind than is sufficient to understand
% the nature of these relationships. This dissertation further explores the interplay between a static
% graph, the translation of that graph from paper to mental representation (the journey from
% eye to brain), and the mental processes that operate on that graph once it is transferred into
% memory (mind). Understanding the perception of statistical graphics will allow researchers
% to create more effective graphs which produce fewer distortions and viewer errors while reducing
% the cognitive load necessary to understand the information presented in the graph.
