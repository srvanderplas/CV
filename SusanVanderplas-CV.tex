It is possible to draw the genealogy in relation to variables related to the nodes, and to determine and display the shortest path distances between the nodes. Production of pairwise distance matrices and genealogical diagrams constrained on generation are also available in the visualization toolkit. The tools are being tested on a dataset with milestone cultivars of soybean varieties (Hymowitz, Newell, and Carmer 1977) as well as on a web-based database of the academic genealogy of mathematicians (North Dakota State University and American Mathematical Society 2010). The latest stable package version is available in source and binary form on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).},

% \cvitem{Committee}{Dr.~Heike Hofmann (Chair), Dr.~Dianne Cook, Dr.~Sarah Nusser, Dr.~Max Morris, Dr.~Stephen Gilbert}
% \cvitem{Abstract}{\small Research on statistical graphics and visualization generally focuses
% on new types of graphics, new software to create graphics, interactivity, and usability
% studies. Our ability to interpret and use statistical graphics hinges on the interface between
% the graph itself and the brain that perceives and interprets it, and there is substantially less
% research on the interplay between graph, eye, brain, and mind than is sufficient to understand
% the nature of these relationships. This dissertation further explores the interplay between a static
% graph, the translation of that graph from paper to mental representation (the journey from
% eye to brain), and the mental processes that operate on that graph once it is transferred into
% memory (mind). Understanding the perception of statistical graphics will allow researchers
% to create more effective graphs which produce fewer distortions and viewer errors while reducing
% the cognitive load necessary to understand the information presented in the graph.
